# INSTALLATION AND USAGE NOTES
In order to run "after_install.sh", you might need to your system that this is an executable file.
You can do that in two ways:
1- "The Graphical Way" is to right click the file and set the "executable" property in the graphic interface of your system, or;
2- "The Command Line Way" is to type (without quotation marks):
"sudo chmod +x /path_to_your_file_here/after_install.sh"

Use it, share it, copy it, comment it and fork it at your own responsability and will!
